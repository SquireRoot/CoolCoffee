    "\n",
    "$t$ - time \\\n",
    "$\\rho$ - density \\\n",

    "\n",
    "The second Euler equation represents conservation of momentum and is derived by applying newton's second law which states that the change in velocity is proportional to the sum of all forces. In the following equation, the density times the change in velocity is equal to the sum of all forces acting on the fluid.
